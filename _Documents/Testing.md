* WHY WE CAN'T RUN TESTS IN PARALLEL??
* Enable change testshell settings
	* Run unit tests in parallel and in memory
* Speed tests => work in memory
* Register(RfClass) //will get dependent types and register all related

# Test Shell Todo
* Get instances for pushed call
* Get matched waits for pushed call


# Write Unit Tests for basic scenarios:
* Add tests for cleaning database
* Attributes test
* Validation, errors, and exceptions is work fine
* Scan results are correct

# Performance Test
* 1 Million active wait for same function
	* With mandatory part exist
	* Without mandatory part exist
* 500 active resumable function
* 100 resumable function activated by one pushed call
* 10000 pushed call per second test


# Generate test code for resumable function
* I plan to auto-generate code for test
