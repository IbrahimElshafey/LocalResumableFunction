# Closure Bug
* Add scope continuation tests for:
	- Global Scope
	- Local Closure scope
	- In sequance
	- In group
	- In function
	- Within After Match Call [May update local or global state]
	- Within Cancel Call [May update local or global state]
	- Within Group match filter [May update local or global state]

* When we resume the execution we use the mutable version of closure 
	* Mutable version may be shared for many waits under same method call





- Multiple replay and local variables

* What if closure is not serializable
