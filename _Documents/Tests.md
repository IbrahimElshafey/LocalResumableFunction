# Write Unit Tests For:
* Sequence
* Wait all
* Wait first
* Wait function
* Wait many functions
* Wait first function
* Replay [to,after,before] for types:
	* To
	* After
	* Before
* Replay in sub functions
* Multiple sub functions levels
* Test loops
* Test Replay
* Write test cases for expressions rewrite because it's critical part
# Performance Test
* 1 Million active wait for same function
	* With mandatory part exist
	* Without mandatory part exist
* 1000 resumable function test
* 1000 pushed call per second test
* One method activate 1000 function type
